<p class="noi"><i>Fellow Citizens, Ladies and Gentlemen</i>:</p>

<p>An attempt to epitomize the events of two hundred
years in an hour’s time is no easy task in any circumstances.
It becomes doubly difficult when those years
are filled with the stirring events that have marked
the history of this community. I do not hesitate to
say that no town of an equal number of inhabitants in
this or any other country has played so conspicuous
a part in the affairs of a state or nation as has the town
whose two hundredth birthday we celebrate. Its very
conception originated in a historic tragedy. Years before
the settlement of the town, our State officials became
convinced of the hostility of the English Government and
its determination to revoke our charter. To frustrate
this design, in part, and to prevent the “Western Lands,”
as they were called, which embraced the territory of this
town—in the words of the enactment—“From falling
into the grasp of Sir Edmund Andros and permitting him
to enrich himself and his minions,” the Legislature, on
January 26, 1686, ordered the sale of those lands to the
Towns of Hartford and Windsor. A few years later,
there dropped from our Royal Oak, in whose bosom safely
lay concealed our hidden charter, an acorn, which by
reason of this action of the legislature, sprouted and blossomed
forth as the Patent of this Town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span></p>

<p>A company was organized in 1718, upon the petition
of Lieutenant John Marsh and Deacon John Buel, and
they, with others, were incorporated by the General Assembly
at its May Session, 1719, to settle a town called
Litchfield on the “Western Lands” at Bantam. These
original settlers were residents of and men of affairs in
the Towns of Wethersfield, Hartford, Windsor, Lebanon
and Farmington.</p>

<p>Among the list of settlers appear names that we hear
uttered almost daily in our streets and today are fortunate
to have some of their descendants still with us—Marsh,
Buel, Woodruff, Webster, Griswold, Gibbs, Stoddard,
Sanford and many others.</p>

<p>The plan of the village has never been materially
changed. The settlers who had the first choice selected
the southern portion of the town along the Bantam River
and Little Pond, presumably because of the natural
meadows which gave them hay for their cattle without
waiting the slow process of clearing the land,—the first
pitch was the upper corner of South Street and Gallows
Lane (then called Middle Street).</p>

<p>Following the usual custom of our Puritan forefathers,
the original proprietors here built a church and then a
school house. From those two sources,—that church and
that school—it is not claiming too much to say there
emanated two of the greatest reforms the world has ever
known. The temperance movement, which has culminated
in the enactment of the Eighteenth Amendment to the
Constitution, and which has now been declared by the
Supreme Court at Washington a binding feature throughout
the length and breadth of our land, seems to have
been initiated here.</p>

<p>It has been stated that the very first Temperance Society
in the world originated in an organization in Litchfield
by an association of our citizens in May, 1789, and a
quite thorough examination of the subject would seem
to verify the truth of this statement. There certainly
was a noble collection of gentlemen here at that time
who did all they could to push forward the temperance
reform.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span></p>

<p>The splendid results did not fully appear until the settlement
of Dr. Lyman Beecher who—though his attack
in the first instance was from a different angle, and
directed toward the clergymen themselves—did perhaps
for that very reason the most effective work. Dr. Beecher’s
attention was first called to the temperance question
through his attendance on the Convocation of Ministers
at the adjoining towns of Plymouth and Sharon. He was
shocked both at the amount of liquor consumed and its
effect on the ministers themselves. It was his fervent
zeal, his sermons and advocacy of the cause that resulted
in the abolition of liquor in ministerial circles, and called
the attention of good citizens the world over to the evils
of intemperance. The Massachusetts Temperance Society,
one of the best conducted and strongest in the country,
is said to have been the direct result of this Litchfield
movement, having been incorporated just a year after Dr.
Beecher’s philippic. Among the many lessons of the late
war, none have impressed the people more than that in
a certain sense we are our brother’s keeper,—that rum
and thrift do not travel together—that “Dutch” courage
cannot compare with moral courage. Think of this, my
fellow-citizens! Within the records of yonder Court
House there is a receipt showing that my own grandfather—when
High Sheriff of this county—purchased
with the money of the State seven gallons of rum for the
refreshment of five of the highest judicial officers of the
State during five days’ session of the Court of Errors!
More than a quart per judge per day! Is it to be wondered
at that some of their opinions at times seemed muddled?</p>

<p>The second great reform which emanated from this
town and church, the schools established here, and the
pure air of freedom which we breathe, was the doom of
slavery, which was sounded when Harriet Beecher Stowe
wrote “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.” John Brown was born
just over the line in Torrington in 1800,—no great distance
from the Beecher Homestead. A man with a modern
rifle, standing on the Grant farm, could have hit either<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
the Beecher Homestead or the John Brown birthplace.
In the words of Oliver Wendell Holmes:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“All through the conflict up and down,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Marched Uncle Tom and old John Brown,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One ghost, one form ideal;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And which was false and which was true,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And which was mightier of the two,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wisest sibyl never knew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For both alike were real.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The crowning victory of our Civil War will ever link
the shores of the Appomattox with the Hills of Litchfield,—and
to make the chain stronger, General Grant,
though not born here, was descended from a family that
for many years lived in and took a great interest in the
affairs of this town.</p>

<p>Fortunately for me, the history of the Litchfield Law
School has been brought before you by a man we all honor
and who did ample justice to the subject, but, as a loyal
son of Litchfield and a lawyer, I am proud of the fact and
wish no one to forget that here was established and carried
on for many years not only the first law school in the
English-speaking world, but one that has for all time impressed
its methods on the legal profession. It is true that
at Oxford, Cambridge and other universities law lectures
were delivered before the establishment of the Litchfield
Law School, but merely as a part of the polite education
of a scholar. There was little attempt to teach the eternal
principles of the law or their practical application.
The influence of the Litchfield Law School was felt
throughout the world, but of course most of all in our own
country. Here the scholars both attended lectures and
recited the lessons they had learned. This it was that
distinguishes it as the first Law School, a school where
lessons were taught. That Law School, Miss Pierce’s
School, and the Morris Academy did much to educate our
people. The late Chief Justice Seymour once said that
when he entered Congress—as late as 1850—he was met
and welcomed by over thirty members of the House, who
had graduated at the Litchfield Law School or had married
women who had graduated at Miss Pierce’s School.</p>

<p>The Morris Academy, under the direction of Captain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
James Morris, a soldier who distinguished himself at the
capture of Cornwallis, also added materially to the education,
interest and influence of the community.</p>

<p>Naturally all the ecclesiastical and religious sentiment
of the community centered around the First Ecclesiastical
Society, the Congregational Church, but as the inhabitants
increased other churches were formed.</p>

<p>Quite early the Episcopalians had the services of a
missionary here, but in 1745, Mr. John Davies, an Englishman
who had settled in the town and was deeply attached
to the principles of the established Church of England,
gathered around him the people of the neighborhood and
organized St. Michael’s Parish, and donated to it a piece
of land on which subsequently a church was erected.
From that day to this, not only Litchfield, but New Milford
has largely benefited by his generosity and the interest
of his family.</p>

<p>The late Bishop Davies of the Diocese of Michigan, and
his son, the Rt. Rev. Thomas F. Davies of the Diocese of
Western Massachusetts, have always taken a great interest
in Litchfield and have often visited here reviving their
family interest in the place of settlement of their ancestors
in this country.</p>

<p>St. Michael’s Church has had the good fortune of having
Rectors distinguished for their piety and ability. Perhaps
the Rev. Henry R. Hudson, the distinguished Shakespearian
scholar, was from a literary point of view, the
most distinguished. He was Rector of the church for two
years and subsequently became Shakespearian Professor
at Harvard University.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic Church, St. Anthony’s Parish,
was started largely through the kindly benevolence and
gifts of Miss Julia Beers, a daughter of the Hon. Seth
P. Beers. Late in life she became deeply interested in
Roman Catholicism, and by her social influence and her
many devoted friends in the town, she gave the Parish
an influence that it has ever since retained.</p>

<p>Our Methodist Brethren ever since 1837 have maintained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
services here, and have always had an influential
and devoted congregation.</p>

<p>Upon the settlement of the town, our forefathers seem
to have pursued a wise and friendly course towards the
Indians, and on the whole—notwithstanding a few unpleasant
instances—there were no serious conflicts.</p>

<p>The community seemed to have had no part in the
first French and Indian War of 1744, commonly called
Queen Anne’s War. On the dispersion of the inhabitants
of Acadia, so graphically described by the historian Bancroft
and the poet Longfellow, some four hundred of
these unfortunate refugees were sent to Connecticut, and
by our Legislature, on January 21st, 1755, distributed
among the different towns of the State. Of these a number
were sent to Litchfield, as appears of record, and some
became permanent inhabitants of the town.</p>

<p>In the last French and Indian War, beginning in 1755,
and continuing until 1763, the town took not only a considerable
but a distinguished part.</p>

<p>By reason of the death of Colonel Williams at the battle
of Lake George, the command of his regiment fell on
Colonel Whiting, then of the Town of New Haven, but
subsequently removing to this town. He distinguished
himself by great coolness, skill and bravery. Colonel
Whiting’s orderly book and sword were valued possessions
of the Whiting family, who, until within a year, have been
residents of the town. The Litchfield Company which, under
the command of Captain Archibald McNeill of Colonel
Whiting’s Regiment—although not composed exclusively
of inhabitants of the town—was enlisted in this
immediate vicinity, and its roster contains the names of
distinguished men from this town, members of whose families
are still living with us—such as the Marshes, Baldwins,
Smiths, Gibbs, Catlins, Warners, Lords, Stoddards,
Beebes, Osborns and Bissells—with many others.</p>

<p>Dr. Timothy Collins, who had been the first Pastor of
the Congregational Church of Litchfield, was appointed
as one of the physicians and surgeons of this Connecticut
Regiment.</p>

<p>Of the part taken by the town in the Revolutionary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
War, the difficulty is in determining what to omit. Without
instituting comparison, it can safely be said that
Litchfield did—as she has always done—her full duty.
Circumstances contributed somewhat to the prominence
of the town. The control of Long Island Sound and the
southern shores of our state by the British ships and
troops necessarily compelled the use of the northern route
between New England and the western and southern
parts of our country. General Washington, when desirous
of a consultation with Count Rochambeau at Wethersfield,
had almost of necessity to pass through Litchfield.
When a place of safety for provisions, stores and prisoners
was required, what better situation could be found
than among our secluded hills? So, when the Royal
Governor—Franklin of New Jersey—and Matthews,
Mayor of New York City, were arrested, and Governor
Trumbull was requested to detain them, he immediately
sent them to Major Moses Seymour, who was then acting
not only as Commissioner of Supplies but of prisoners as
well—to be detained, and the original warrant for the
detention of Mayor Matthews is now in the possession of
Judge Woodruff.</p>

<p>None of the Colonies’ soldiers west of the Connecticut
River was ordered to Boston at the time of the Lexington
Alarm. Only those east of the river received orders to
march, while those on the west side were generally instructed
to await orders. At the battles of Lexington,
Concord and Bunker Hill, if any of our townsmen participated,
it was as individuals—as they did when
Arnold marched to Quebec. But the most thrilling event
of this time was undertaken by a Litchfield man—born
in a house still standing if tradition is to be believed—Colonel
Ethan Allen, who was in command of the troops
that captured Ticonderoga, and who demanded the surrender
of the fortress,—“In the name of the Great Jehovah
and the Continental Congress,” nearly fourteen
months before the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p>Before the War, Connecticut had no cavalry regiment,
as such. Each regiment of infantry had a troop of horse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
attached to it, consisting of one company. Soon after the
beginning of the War, these companies were consolidated
in a cavalry regiment and placed under the command of
Colonel Elisha Sheldon—which regiment soon became the
pride of the army, and was subsequently reorganized as
the United States First Dragoons.</p>

<p>The conspicuous part which that regiment played in
the War is of common knowledge and need not be dwelt
upon. When Washington needed protection in his retreat
from Long Island and through the Jerseys, it was this
regiment which acted as rear guard and protected
his retreat through the state. Colonel Sheldon was a distinguished
and valuable citizen of the town, and I have
reason to believe that the house in which he lived is still
standing.</p>

<p>The pulling down of the equestrian statue of George
III on the Bowling Green in New York and the bringing
of it to Litchfield to be moulded into bullets by the fair
women of our town is an incident too well known to require
special mention, but it has always seemed to the
writer to have a semi-comic as well as a tragic side. A
British soldier maimed by a bullet moulded by Yankee
Rebel women out of a statue erected to honor his King,
must have had mingled feelings; his loyalty to the King
prohibited his having any ill-feeling toward the statue,
but his respect for the ladies of Litchfield must have been
considerably lowered.</p>

<p>When the importance of defeating General Burgoyne
in his attempt to separate New England from New York
and the western and southern states became apparent,
General Schuyler sent word to General Wolcott to hasten
forward to Albany as many as possible of the Connecticut
troops. General Wolcott with his usual promptness without
waiting instructions from Gen. Washington or Gov.
Trumbull, ordered all the Connecticut troops west of the
Connecticut River to proceed immediately to Albany.
The Litchfield Troop of Horse, under Major Moses Seymour,
and the Infantry Company, under Captain Beebe,
marched immediately, and participated in the Battles of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
Stillwater, Bemis Heights and the final victory at Saratoga,
which victory Cressey—in his enumeration of the
famous battles of the world—includes as one of the most
important.</p>

<p>There is an interesting and prophetic incident related
of the banquet to which General Gates invited General
Burgoyne and his officers, after the surrender, at which
General Burgoyne in response to a request for a toast,
after some hesitation, arose and said: “I give you England
and America against the world.”</p>

<p>At the attacks on Danbury and New Haven, our Litchfield
soldiers rushed to the assistance of both places.
From Danbury down to the place of debarkation at Compo
Beach, they pursued, attacked and harrassed Tryon’s
troops, capturing and killing many of them.</p>

<p>Colonel Benjamin Tallmadge, aide de camp to General
Washington, and one of the most distinguished officers
of the Revolution, deserves more attention than we have
time to give to his many valuable services. His part in
the trial and execution of Major Andre called the attention
of the British, French and American commanders to
his every action, and excited universal approbation. His
firmness, benevolent judgment and kindly care of Andre,
and his irresistible outburst of tears as that splendid British
officer swung into eternity from the ignominious gibbet,
gave complete evidence of the tenderness of his disposition—but
which could not swerve his fidelity to duty.
After the War he returned to his home here, and shortly
after was elected to Congress where again he rendered
valuable services to the nation.</p>

<p>In the War with Mexico, although New England was
not particularly enthusiastic in its prosecution, Connecticut
did its part. It was a Litchfield boy, Henry W. Wessells,
subsequently became a General in the Regular
Army, who—while a brave Connecticut Colonel was pulling
down the Mexican flag and raising the Stars and
Stripes over the Mexican stronghold, the fortress of
Chapultepec—stood beside him and protected him from
assault.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>In the Civil War, our town did its full duty. The Connecticut
Nineteenth Regiment was recruited, encamped
and trained on Chestnut Hill, and marched away to join
the Army of the Potomac under command of our townsman,
Colonel Leverett W. Wessells. No finer body of men
ever left the State. At Manassas, Cold Harbor, Spottsylvania,
Winchester, Hanover Court House, Cedar Creek,
City Point, Hatchet’s Run, Petersburg and Fisher Hill, it
earned a glorious and well-deserved reputation for bravery
and faithful service. It was early transferred into
an artillery regiment, the Second Connecticut Heavies, as
it was called, and placed under the command of Colonel
E. S. Kellogg, and subsequently R. S. MacKenzie of the
Engineers. Under their command the Second Connecticut
Heavies became one of the most useful and distinguished
regiments of the Civil War. Colonel Kellogg was killed
while attacking General Longstreet’s veteran corps at
Cold Harbor. Of our citizens, the names connected with
this Regiment that comes to one’s mind most intimately
are the beloved Clerk of the Superior Court, Dwight C.
Kilbourn, of Hinsdale, Shumway, Bissell, Smith, Stone,
Morse, Wadhams, Plumb, Wheeler and many more we
knew and loved.</p>

<p>In the Spanish War, when the American Fleet was
attacking Manila and the German ships of war seemed
to be intentionally blocking its way, it was our fellow-citizen,
Rear Admiral Colvocoresses, loved and respected
by all of us, who ably assisted Admiral Dewey—both
equally willing to fight Germany if necessary. It would
perhaps have been as well for the world had our war with
Germany begun then and there.</p>

<p>Though this is a sketch dealing with Litchfield’s past,
I would not be true to its traditions if I omitted to mention
the shining glory of those boys of ours who laid down
their lives in France for their country, for democracy and
the good of mankind in the World War—Morgan, Weir,
Devines, Jefferies, Catty, Cornwall, Donahue, Guinchi,
Sherry and Zarotti. I like to think it was the spirit of
Litchfield and their loyalty to the best traditions of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
town that made them “go over” and “carry on” so nobly.</p>

<p>As brilliant and effective as were the efforts of our forefathers
on the battlefields of the Republic, the record of
their civic achievements in no way fades by comparison.</p>

<p>Connecticut sent our fellow-citizen Oliver Wolcott, to
sign the Declaration of Independence, and after his return
from Congress he was elected Governor of the State
and served for two years. When Presidents Washington
and Adams needed a man as Secretary of the Treasury
of the United States, to assist Alexander Hamilton in
straightening out the financial affairs of the nation after
the Revolution,—they turned to Litchfield and selected
Oliver Wolcott, Jr., son of the Governor, for that important
duty, who on his return was elected Governor, of
the State, a position he occupied some ten years. The only
other Governor of the State from Litchfield was the late
Charles B. Andrews, at one time Chief Justice of the
State.</p>

<p>Connecticut has chosen five Chief Justices of the State
from residents of this town,—Andrew Adams, Tapping
Reeve, Samuel Church, Origen S. Seymour and Charles
B. Andrews. Eight Justices of our Superior Court
have also come from our town. Two United States
Senators, ten Members of Congress, seven Members of
the Council, besides numerous Chief Justices and Judges
of the County Court, with ten High Sheriffs of the County.</p>

<p>When the State of New York desired a man to associate
with DeWitt Clinton on the construction of the Erie
Canal, they selected Henry Seymour formerly of Litchfield,
then a resident of Utica.</p>

<p>A complete list of the important offices filled by Litchfield
men would take too long to recite.</p>

<p>The social life of the town could hardly be otherwise
than agreeable and attractive. Litchfield has ever welcomed
the refined educated person, and extended to him
or her its warmest welcome. The heads of its families
were not only well educated men and women, but usually
occupied high social position in the state and nation. The
young people in attendance at Miss Pierce’s, the Law<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
School and the Morris Academy were of the same high
type collected from all the various States of the Union.
There was enough serious work to occupy their time and
give zest to their hours of rest and recreation. Mrs. Vanderpoel
in her delightful book, “A Pioneer’s School” has
collected many graphic descriptions of the amusements
and pleasant times that they enjoyed.</p>

<p>Samuel Goodrich, writing under the name of Peter Parley,
has this to say, “Litchfield Hill was in fact not only
one of the most elevated features in the physical formation
of the State, but one of the focal points of literature
and enlightenment.” He goes on to tell of an incident in
reference to Dr. Lyman Beecher, which speaks volumes
for the common sense of the good old Doctor: One evening
Dr. Beecher was returning home, having in his hand
a volume of Rees’ Encyclopedia which he had just purchased
from the book store. On his way he met a skunk
and threw the book at him, upon which the animal retaliated
with such effect that when the Doctor reached home
he was in a very shocking plight. Sometime after, having
been bitterly assailed and abused by an opponent, his
friends advised him to reply. “No,” said the Doctor, “I
once discharged a quarto at a skunk and I got the worst
of it. I do not wish to try it again.” The witticisms of the
town were proverbial, and did time permit to repeat,
though often before repeated, would be enjoyable. To
me the reply of Senator Tracy to Senator Randolph of
Virginia has always seemed a nearly perfect specimen of
wit. Senator Randolph hastily called Senator Tracy to
the window of the Senate Chamber to see some of his
“Connecticut Constituents.” Senator Tracy came to the
window as a drove of mules was being driven by. Turning
to Senator Randolph he said, “Oh yes, they are going
down to Virginia to teach school.”</p>

<p>There is also that delightfully witty repartee of the
Senator which so gallantly described for all time the ladies
of Litchfield. Mr. Lister, the then British Ambassador,
who was thoroughly English in his ideas, said to General<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
Tracy, “your countrywoman—Mrs. Wolcott—would
be admired even at St. James.” “Sir,” retorted Senator
Tracy, “she is admired even on Litchfield Hill.”</p>

<p>My friends, I have mentioned only a few of the men
whose character and attainments have contributed to the
upbuilding of this town, of our state and of our nation.
Not to forgetfulness of their worth but to lack of time
must omissions be attributed. Many are the names among
our forefathers that set an example of Godly living,
loyalty and patriotism which never can be surpassed.
May we and our descendants be as faithful when called to
serve our God, our country and our town.</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
