_Fellow Citizens, Ladies and Gentlemen_:

An attempt to epitomize the events of two hundred years in an hour’s
time is no easy task in any circumstances. It becomes doubly difficult
when those years are filled with the stirring events that have marked
the history of this community. I do not hesitate to say that no town of
an equal number of inhabitants in this or any other country has played
so conspicuous a part in the affairs of a state or nation as has the
town whose two hundredth birthday we celebrate. Its very conception
originated in a historic tragedy. Years before the settlement of the
town, our State officials became convinced of the hostility of the
English Government and its determination to revoke our charter. To
frustrate this design, in part, and to prevent the “Western Lands,” as
they were called, which embraced the territory of this town――in the
words of the enactment――“From falling into the grasp of Sir Edmund
Andros and permitting him to enrich himself and his minions,” the
Legislature, on January 26, 1686, ordered the sale of those lands to
the Towns of Hartford and Windsor. A few years later, there dropped
from our Royal Oak, in whose bosom safely lay concealed our hidden
charter, an acorn, which by reason of this action of the legislature,
sprouted and blossomed forth as the Patent of this Town.

A company was organized in 1718, upon the petition of Lieutenant John
Marsh and Deacon John Buel, and they, with others, were incorporated by
the General Assembly at its May Session, 1719, to settle a town called
Litchfield on the “Western Lands” at Bantam. These original settlers
were residents of and men of affairs in the Towns of Wethersfield,
Hartford, Windsor, Lebanon and Farmington.

Among the list of settlers appear names that we hear uttered almost
daily in our streets and today are fortunate to have some of their
descendants still with us――Marsh, Buel, Woodruff, Webster, Griswold,
Gibbs, Stoddard, Sanford and many others.

The plan of the village has never been materially changed. The settlers
who had the first choice selected the southern portion of the town
along the Bantam River and Little Pond, presumably because of the
natural meadows which gave them hay for their cattle without waiting
the slow process of clearing the land,――the first pitch was the upper
corner of South Street and Gallows Lane (then called Middle Street).

Following the usual custom of our Puritan forefathers, the original
proprietors here built a church and then a school house. From those
two sources,――that church and that school――it is not claiming too much
to say there emanated two of the greatest reforms the world has ever
known. The temperance movement, which has culminated in the enactment
of the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution, and which has now
been declared by the Supreme Court at Washington a binding feature
throughout the length and breadth of our land, seems to have been
initiated here.

It has been stated that the very first Temperance Society in the world
originated in an organization in Litchfield by an association of our
citizens in May, 1789, and a quite thorough examination of the subject
would seem to verify the truth of this statement. There certainly was a
noble collection of gentlemen here at that time who did all they could
to push forward the temperance reform.

The splendid results did not fully appear until the settlement of Dr.
Lyman Beecher who――though his attack in the first instance was from
a different angle, and directed toward the clergymen themselves――did
perhaps for that very reason the most effective work. Dr. Beecher’s
attention was first called to the temperance question through his
attendance on the Convocation of Ministers at the adjoining towns
of Plymouth and Sharon. He was shocked both at the amount of liquor
consumed and its effect on the ministers themselves. It was his
fervent zeal, his sermons and advocacy of the cause that resulted
in the abolition of liquor in ministerial circles, and called the
attention of good citizens the world over to the evils of intemperance.
The Massachusetts Temperance Society, one of the best conducted and
strongest in the country, is said to have been the direct result of
this Litchfield movement, having been incorporated just a year after
Dr. Beecher’s philippic. Among the many lessons of the late war, none
have impressed the people more than that in a certain sense we are our
brother’s keeper,――that rum and thrift do not travel together――that
“Dutch” courage cannot compare with moral courage. Think of this, my
fellow-citizens! Within the records of yonder Court House there is a
receipt showing that my own grandfather――when High Sheriff of this
county――purchased with the money of the State seven gallons of rum for
the refreshment of five of the highest judicial officers of the State
during five days’ session of the Court of Errors! More than a quart per
judge per day! Is it to be wondered at that some of their opinions at
times seemed muddled?

The second great reform which emanated from this town and church, the
schools established here, and the pure air of freedom which we breathe,
was the doom of slavery, which was sounded when Harriet Beecher Stowe
wrote “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.” John Brown was born just over the line in
Torrington in 1800,――no great distance from the Beecher Homestead. A
man with a modern rifle, standing on the Grant farm, could have hit
either the Beecher Homestead or the John Brown birthplace. In the
words of Oliver Wendell Holmes:

    “All through the conflict up and down,
    Marched Uncle Tom and old John Brown,
    One ghost, one form ideal;
    And which was false and which was true,
    And which was mightier of the two,
    The wisest sibyl never knew,
    For both alike were real.”

The crowning victory of our Civil War will ever link the shores of
the Appomattox with the Hills of Litchfield,――and to make the chain
stronger, General Grant, though not born here, was descended from a
family that for many years lived in and took a great interest in the
affairs of this town.

Fortunately for me, the history of the Litchfield Law School has been
brought before you by a man we all honor and who did ample justice
to the subject, but, as a loyal son of Litchfield and a lawyer, I am
proud of the fact and wish no one to forget that here was established
and carried on for many years not only the first law school in the
English-speaking world, but one that has for all time impressed its
methods on the legal profession. It is true that at Oxford, Cambridge
and other universities law lectures were delivered before the
establishment of the Litchfield Law School, but merely as a part of
the polite education of a scholar. There was little attempt to teach
the eternal principles of the law or their practical application. The
influence of the Litchfield Law School was felt throughout the world,
but of course most of all in our own country. Here the scholars both
attended lectures and recited the lessons they had learned. This it was
that distinguishes it as the first Law School, a school where lessons
were taught. That Law School, Miss Pierce’s School, and the Morris
Academy did much to educate our people. The late Chief Justice Seymour
once said that when he entered Congress――as late as 1850――he was met
and welcomed by over thirty members of the House, who had graduated at
the Litchfield Law School or had married women who had graduated at
Miss Pierce’s School.

The Morris Academy, under the direction of Captain James Morris, a
soldier who distinguished himself at the capture of Cornwallis, also
added materially to the education, interest and influence of the
community.

Naturally all the ecclesiastical and religious sentiment of the
community centered around the First Ecclesiastical Society, the
Congregational Church, but as the inhabitants increased other churches
were formed.

Quite early the Episcopalians had the services of a missionary here,
but in 1745, Mr. John Davies, an Englishman who had settled in the
town and was deeply attached to the principles of the established
Church of England, gathered around him the people of the neighborhood
and organized St. Michael’s Parish, and donated to it a piece of land
on which subsequently a church was erected. From that day to this,
not only Litchfield, but New Milford has largely benefited by his
generosity and the interest of his family.

The late Bishop Davies of the Diocese of Michigan, and his son, the Rt.
Rev. Thomas F. Davies of the Diocese of Western Massachusetts, have
always taken a great interest in Litchfield and have often visited here
reviving their family interest in the place of settlement of their
ancestors in this country.

St. Michael’s Church has had the good fortune of having Rectors
distinguished for their piety and ability. Perhaps the Rev. Henry R.
Hudson, the distinguished Shakespearian scholar, was from a literary
point of view, the most distinguished. He was Rector of the church for
two years and subsequently became Shakespearian Professor at Harvard
University.

The Roman Catholic Church, St. Anthony’s Parish, was started largely
through the kindly benevolence and gifts of Miss Julia Beers, a
daughter of the Hon. Seth P. Beers. Late in life she became deeply
interested in Roman Catholicism, and by her social influence and her
many devoted friends in the town, she gave the Parish an influence that
it has ever since retained.

Our Methodist Brethren ever since 1837 have maintained services here,
and have always had an influential and devoted congregation.

Upon the settlement of the town, our forefathers seem to have
pursued a wise and friendly course towards the Indians, and on the
whole――notwithstanding a few unpleasant instances――there were no
serious conflicts.

The community seemed to have had no part in the first French and Indian
War of 1744, commonly called Queen Anne’s War. On the dispersion of
the inhabitants of Acadia, so graphically described by the historian
Bancroft and the poet Longfellow, some four hundred of these
unfortunate refugees were sent to Connecticut, and by our Legislature,
on January 21st, 1755, distributed among the different towns of the
State. Of these a number were sent to Litchfield, as appears of record,
and some became permanent inhabitants of the town.

In the last French and Indian War, beginning in 1755, and continuing
until 1763, the town took not only a considerable but a distinguished
part.

By reason of the death of Colonel Williams at the battle of Lake
George, the command of his regiment fell on Colonel Whiting, then of
the Town of New Haven, but subsequently removing to this town. He
distinguished himself by great coolness, skill and bravery. Colonel
Whiting’s orderly book and sword were valued possessions of the
Whiting family, who, until within a year, have been residents of the
town. The Litchfield Company which, under the command of Captain
Archibald McNeill of Colonel Whiting’s Regiment――although not composed
exclusively of inhabitants of the town――was enlisted in this immediate
vicinity, and its roster contains the names of distinguished men from
this town, members of whose families are still living with us――such
as the Marshes, Baldwins, Smiths, Gibbs, Catlins, Warners, Lords,
Stoddards, Beebes, Osborns and Bissells――with many others.

Dr. Timothy Collins, who had been the first Pastor of the
Congregational Church of Litchfield, was appointed as one of the
physicians and surgeons of this Connecticut Regiment.

Of the part taken by the town in the Revolutionary War, the difficulty
is in determining what to omit. Without instituting comparison, it can
safely be said that Litchfield did――as she has always done――her full
duty. Circumstances contributed somewhat to the prominence of the town.
The control of Long Island Sound and the southern shores of our state
by the British ships and troops necessarily compelled the use of the
northern route between New England and the western and southern parts
of our country. General Washington, when desirous of a consultation
with Count Rochambeau at Wethersfield, had almost of necessity to pass
through Litchfield. When a place of safety for provisions, stores
and prisoners was required, what better situation could be found
than among our secluded hills? So, when the Royal Governor――Franklin
of New Jersey――and Matthews, Mayor of New York City, were arrested,
and Governor Trumbull was requested to detain them, he immediately
sent them to Major Moses Seymour, who was then acting not only as
Commissioner of Supplies but of prisoners as well――to be detained, and
the original warrant for the detention of Mayor Matthews is now in the
possession of Judge Woodruff.

None of the Colonies’ soldiers west of the Connecticut River was
ordered to Boston at the time of the Lexington Alarm. Only those east
of the river received orders to march, while those on the west side
were generally instructed to await orders. At the battles of Lexington,
Concord and Bunker Hill, if any of our townsmen participated, it was as
individuals――as they did when Arnold marched to Quebec. But the most
thrilling event of this time was undertaken by a Litchfield man――born
in a house still standing if tradition is to be believed――Colonel Ethan
Allen, who was in command of the troops that captured Ticonderoga, and
who demanded the surrender of the fortress,――“In the name of the Great
Jehovah and the Continental Congress,” nearly fourteen months before
the Declaration of Independence.

Before the War, Connecticut had no cavalry regiment, as such. Each
regiment of infantry had a troop of horse attached to it, consisting
of one company. Soon after the beginning of the War, these companies
were consolidated in a cavalry regiment and placed under the command
of Colonel Elisha Sheldon――which regiment soon became the pride of
the army, and was subsequently reorganized as the United States First
Dragoons.

The conspicuous part which that regiment played in the War is of common
knowledge and need not be dwelt upon. When Washington needed protection
in his retreat from Long Island and through the Jerseys, it was this
regiment which acted as rear guard and protected his retreat through
the state. Colonel Sheldon was a distinguished and valuable citizen of
the town, and I have reason to believe that the house in which he lived
is still standing.

The pulling down of the equestrian statue of George III on the Bowling
Green in New York and the bringing of it to Litchfield to be moulded
into bullets by the fair women of our town is an incident too well
known to require special mention, but it has always seemed to the
writer to have a semi-comic as well as a tragic side. A British
soldier maimed by a bullet moulded by Yankee Rebel women out of a
statue erected to honor his King, must have had mingled feelings; his
loyalty to the King prohibited his having any ill-feeling toward the
statue, but his respect for the ladies of Litchfield must have been
considerably lowered.

When the importance of defeating General Burgoyne in his attempt
to separate New England from New York and the western and southern
states became apparent, General Schuyler sent word to General Wolcott
to hasten forward to Albany as many as possible of the Connecticut
troops. General Wolcott with his usual promptness without waiting
instructions from Gen. Washington or Gov. Trumbull, ordered all the
Connecticut troops west of the Connecticut River to proceed immediately
to Albany. The Litchfield Troop of Horse, under Major Moses Seymour,
and the Infantry Company, under Captain Beebe, marched immediately, and
participated in the Battles of Stillwater, Bemis Heights and the final
victory at Saratoga, which victory Cressey――in his enumeration of the
famous battles of the world――includes as one of the most important.

There is an interesting and prophetic incident related of the banquet
to which General Gates invited General Burgoyne and his officers, after
the surrender, at which General Burgoyne in response to a request for a
toast, after some hesitation, arose and said: “I give you England and
America against the world.”

At the attacks on Danbury and New Haven, our Litchfield soldiers rushed
to the assistance of both places. From Danbury down to the place of
debarkation at Compo Beach, they pursued, attacked and harrassed
Tryon’s troops, capturing and killing many of them.

Colonel Benjamin Tallmadge, aide de camp to General Washington, and one
of the most distinguished officers of the Revolution, deserves more
attention than we have time to give to his many valuable services.
His part in the trial and execution of Major Andre called the
attention of the British, French and American commanders to his every
action, and excited universal approbation. His firmness, benevolent
judgment and kindly care of Andre, and his irresistible outburst of
tears as that splendid British officer swung into eternity from the
ignominious gibbet, gave complete evidence of the tenderness of his
disposition――but which could not swerve his fidelity to duty. After
the War he returned to his home here, and shortly after was elected to
Congress where again he rendered valuable services to the nation.

In the War with Mexico, although New England was not particularly
enthusiastic in its prosecution, Connecticut did its part. It was a
Litchfield boy, Henry W. Wessells, subsequently became a General in the
Regular Army, who――while a brave Connecticut Colonel was pulling down
the Mexican flag and raising the Stars and Stripes over the Mexican
stronghold, the fortress of Chapultepec――stood beside him and protected
him from assault.

In the Civil War, our town did its full duty. The Connecticut
Nineteenth Regiment was recruited, encamped and trained on Chestnut
Hill, and marched away to join the Army of the Potomac under command of
our townsman, Colonel Leverett W. Wessells. No finer body of men ever
left the State. At Manassas, Cold Harbor, Spottsylvania, Winchester,
Hanover Court House, Cedar Creek, City Point, Hatchet’s Run, Petersburg
and Fisher Hill, it earned a glorious and well-deserved reputation
for bravery and faithful service. It was early transferred into an
artillery regiment, the Second Connecticut Heavies, as it was called,
and placed under the command of Colonel E. S. Kellogg, and subsequently
R. S. MacKenzie of the Engineers. Under their command the Second
Connecticut Heavies became one of the most useful and distinguished
regiments of the Civil War. Colonel Kellogg was killed while attacking
General Longstreet’s veteran corps at Cold Harbor. Of our citizens,
the names connected with this Regiment that comes to one’s mind most
intimately are the beloved Clerk of the Superior Court, Dwight C.
Kilbourn, of Hinsdale, Shumway, Bissell, Smith, Stone, Morse, Wadhams,
Plumb, Wheeler and many more we knew and loved.

In the Spanish War, when the American Fleet was attacking Manila and
the German ships of war seemed to be intentionally blocking its way, it
was our fellow-citizen, Rear Admiral Colvocoresses, loved and respected
by all of us, who ably assisted Admiral Dewey――both equally willing to
fight Germany if necessary. It would perhaps have been as well for the
world had our war with Germany begun then and there.

Though this is a sketch dealing with Litchfield’s past, I would
not be true to its traditions if I omitted to mention the shining
glory of those boys of ours who laid down their lives in France for
their country, for democracy and the good of mankind in the World
War――Morgan, Weir, Devines, Jefferies, Catty, Cornwall, Donahue,
Guinchi, Sherry and Zarotti. I like to think it was the spirit of
Litchfield and their loyalty to the best traditions of this town that
made them “go over” and “carry on” so nobly.

As brilliant and effective as were the efforts of our forefathers
on the battlefields of the Republic, the record of their civic
achievements in no way fades by comparison.

Connecticut sent our fellow-citizen Oliver Wolcott, to sign the
Declaration of Independence, and after his return from Congress he was
elected Governor of the State and served for two years. When Presidents
Washington and Adams needed a man as Secretary of the Treasury of the
United States, to assist Alexander Hamilton in straightening out the
financial affairs of the nation after the Revolution,――they turned to
Litchfield and selected Oliver Wolcott, Jr., son of the Governor, for
that important duty, who on his return was elected Governor, of the
State, a position he occupied some ten years. The only other Governor
of the State from Litchfield was the late Charles B. Andrews, at one
time Chief Justice of the State.

Connecticut has chosen five Chief Justices of the State from residents
of this town,――Andrew Adams, Tapping Reeve, Samuel Church, Origen S.
Seymour and Charles B. Andrews. Eight Justices of our Superior Court
have also come from our town. Two United States Senators, ten Members
of Congress, seven Members of the Council, besides numerous Chief
Justices and Judges of the County Court, with ten High Sheriffs of the
County.

When the State of New York desired a man to associate with DeWitt
Clinton on the construction of the Erie Canal, they selected Henry
Seymour formerly of Litchfield, then a resident of Utica.

A complete list of the important offices filled by Litchfield men would
take too long to recite.

The social life of the town could hardly be otherwise than agreeable
and attractive. Litchfield has ever welcomed the refined educated
person, and extended to him or her its warmest welcome. The heads of
its families were not only well educated men and women, but usually
occupied high social position in the state and nation. The young people
in attendance at Miss Pierce’s, the Law School and the Morris Academy
were of the same high type collected from all the various States of
the Union. There was enough serious work to occupy their time and
give zest to their hours of rest and recreation. Mrs. Vanderpoel in
her delightful book, “A Pioneer’s School” has collected many graphic
descriptions of the amusements and pleasant times that they enjoyed.

Samuel Goodrich, writing under the name of Peter Parley, has this to
say, “Litchfield Hill was in fact not only one of the most elevated
features in the physical formation of the State, but one of the focal
points of literature and enlightenment.” He goes on to tell of an
incident in reference to Dr. Lyman Beecher, which speaks volumes for
the common sense of the good old Doctor: One evening Dr. Beecher was
returning home, having in his hand a volume of Rees’ Encyclopedia which
he had just purchased from the book store. On his way he met a skunk
and threw the book at him, upon which the animal retaliated with such
effect that when the Doctor reached home he was in a very shocking
plight. Sometime after, having been bitterly assailed and abused by an
opponent, his friends advised him to reply. “No,” said the Doctor, “I
once discharged a quarto at a skunk and I got the worst of it. I do
not wish to try it again.” The witticisms of the town were proverbial,
and did time permit to repeat, though often before repeated, would be
enjoyable. To me the reply of Senator Tracy to Senator Randolph of
Virginia has always seemed a nearly perfect specimen of wit. Senator
Randolph hastily called Senator Tracy to the window of the Senate
Chamber to see some of his “Connecticut Constituents.” Senator Tracy
came to the window as a drove of mules was being driven by. Turning to
Senator Randolph he said, “Oh yes, they are going down to Virginia to
teach school.”

There is also that delightfully witty repartee of the Senator which so
gallantly described for all time the ladies of Litchfield. Mr. Lister,
the then British Ambassador, who was thoroughly English in his ideas,
said to General Tracy, “your countrywoman――Mrs. Wolcott――would be
admired even at St. James.” “Sir,” retorted Senator Tracy, “she is
admired even on Litchfield Hill.”

My friends, I have mentioned only a few of the men whose character and
attainments have contributed to the upbuilding of this town, of our
state and of our nation. Not to forgetfulness of their worth but to
lack of time must omissions be attributed. Many are the names among our
forefathers that set an example of Godly living, loyalty and patriotism
which never can be surpassed. May we and our descendants be as faithful
when called to serve our God, our country and our town.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
